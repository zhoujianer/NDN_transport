\section{Background}
We recall some features of NDN that we will use to design our transport mechanism. The full description of NDN can be found in NDN paper\cite{NDN}\cite{Adaptive}.

Data feedback. In NDN, consumers send Interest to request Data. The router uses Content Store, Pending Interest Table(PIT) and Forwarding Information Base(FIB) to return , record and forward the Interest respectively. For consumers, one Interest pull back exactly one Data. As the PIT maintains every Interest's state, such as the coming and leaving entry, the Data will come back along exactly the same path with Interest. Such ``same path" feedback let the Data natively act as carrier to bring back the ECN information to consumers.

Adaptive forwarding. Adaptive forwarding is a main feature of NDN data plain. In TCP/IP, forwarding table completely follows the route table without any adaptability, and there is just one path to the destination in the route table. However in NDN, during the forwarding process, router can adaptively choose a forwarding interface from several available paths according the network situation. In \cite{Adaptive} Cheng, etc. make use of the adaptive forwarding mechanism to design a hop-by-hop congestion control mechanism. Routers adaptively forward the Interest to another interface (if available) when it detects that the next hop has been congested. Such adaptive forwarding way helps the network solve congestion much easier than the route assistant congestion in TCP/IP, because the route-assistant congestion mechanism needs the help of route protocol\cite{selfish}. However such just one hop detection is not enough if the congestion happens on later link, because the one hop detection cannot sense it.  SDN-style solution can get the network-wide information\cite{SDN}. And such network-wide information is a promise way to overcome the limit of the just one hop information.
